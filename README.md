# Q's Design Casino 🎲

> Experimenting with design in the AI space — sharing thoughts, processes, and guidelines

## Why This Exists

The pace of AI innovation is relentless. Chasing every update can distract from solving real user problems.

**The challenge isn't keeping up with change** — it's applying judgment and shaping context so tools serve our craft, our industry, and most importantly, our users.

This keeps **creativity and oversight at the center** while enabling speed and trust.

### What I'm Exploring Here

**Openness as a design skill**  
Practical ways to foster curiosity and adaptability. Why openness matters more than mastery.

**Team sport mindset**  
How cross-functional collaboration and shared context drive trust and velocity.

**Practical frameworks**  
Judgment, transparency, and human oversight in AI-driven workflows. Building processes that amplify creativity, not replace it.

## What's Inside

### [Design Process](./design-process)
Exploring design methodologies, frameworks, and approaches for working in the AI space.

### [Skills and Guidelines](./skills-and-guidelines)
Core capabilities, principles, and best practices for creating thoughtful AI-driven experiences.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A living document of design experiments and learnings
- A space for testing new approaches to AI design
- A resource for others navigating design in AI
- A place for open thinking about what design means in this space

## Why "Design Casino"?

Designing for AI is a bit like a casino — sometimes you win, sometimes you learn. But every experiment teaches us something valuable about what works and what doesn't.
