# Writing & Style Preferences

Personal guidelines for content in this repository and beyond.

## Punctuation

**No em dashes (—)**  
Use colons, commas, or separate sentences instead.

✅ Good: "The challenge isn't keeping up: it's applying judgment."  
✅ Good: "The challenge isn't keeping up. It's applying judgment."  
❌ Avoid: "The challenge isn't keeping up — it's applying judgment."

## Heading Style

- **Main titles**: Title Case or ALL CAPS  
- **Subsections**: Sentence case (only first word capitalized)

## Tone

- Direct and clear
- Action-oriented
- Designer-focused perspective
- Experimental but thoughtful

## Emojis

**No emojis**  
Exception: Keep the casino dice 🎲 in the main repo title for brand consistency only.
